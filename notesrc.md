# notesrc 5 2023-09-10 "1.6" "User Commands"
## NAME
notesrc - NDC's notes configuration file.

## DESCRIPTION
*notes* uses a directory and its subdirectories to store the user's notes in files.
See `notebook` bellow.
The files can be plain text, markdown or anything else that
can configured by *rule* statements in the configuration file.

During startup *notes* reads the configuration file
`$XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/notes/noterc` or `~/.config/notes/noterc` or `~/.notesrc`;
whichever is encountered first.

## VARIABLES

#### notebook = <directory>
The directory where the files are located.
If the directory is not specified then,
if *~/Nextcloud/Notes* found, it will
be used, otherwise the *~/.notes* will be used.

#### backupdir = <directory>
The *notes* stores backup files of the notes before edited or deleted.
If *backupdir* is omitted then environment variable *$BACKUPDIR* will be used if set;
otherwise no backup will be used.

#### deftype = <extension>
This is the default extension file name when the user does not specify one in a new
note - name.

```
deftype=txt
```

#### onstart = <command-line>
Command to execute at startup of TUI or by option `--onstart`.

#### onexit = <command-line>
Command to execute at exit of TUI or by option `--onexit`.

#### clobber = <boolean>
Protection of unintentionally overwrite (same as shell).
Default is true.

#### pvhead = <boolean>
Display file information on preview window.
Default is true.

## STATEMENTS
The variable `%f` contains the list of relative path names of selected notes or the
current one. Use `%%` to get a single percent sign. Also, the application pass
this list to environment variable *$NOTESFILES* and the notes root directory to
*$NOTESDIR*. The working directory is always the *$NOTESDIR* and files are
relative to this.

#### rule *action* *pattern* *command*
*Rules* defines how the program will act of each file type.
There are two *actions* for now, *view* and *edit*.

```
rule view *.[0-9] man %f
rule view *.man   man %f
rule view *.md    bat %f
rule view *.txt   less %f
rule view *.pdf   zathura %f
rule edit *       $EDITOR %f
```

#### exclude *pattern* [*pattern* ...]
File match patterns of files and/or directories to ignore.

```
exclude .git trash *.sqlite
```

#### umenu *label* ; *command*
Specifies user-defined menu item to deal with current or tagged files.
The command will get the full path files as parameters.
Use the 'm' key to invoke the user-defined menu.

```
umenu print the files ; echo %f
umenu print the contents ; cat %f
umenu copy to clipbard ; xclip -i %f
```

#### color *label* *attribute*

The *label* can be:
* `normal` default screen color
* `status` status line color
* `select` selected item / text
* `key` short-keys in status bar
* `text` markdown text color
* `code` markdown code 
* `bold` markdown bold / title
* `hide` markdown useless text

The *Attribute* is encoded as VGA text mode character attributes,
that means VGA-background-color << 4 | VGA-forground-color

#### map *map* *key* [*command*]
Assign or remove a key. If you don't specify the *command* parameter then
removes the key from the *map*. There are two maps, the `nav` which works
on browsing and the `input` which works on data input (string, menus and
anything wants normal characters as data).

There are some limitations of ncurses, for example, function keys cannot have
modifier as Shift, Alt or Control.

```
map nav ^R rename
map nav A-r rename
map nav C-A-R rename
```
